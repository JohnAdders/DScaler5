Known bugs to fix

- See \todo entries in file

New functionality to add

- Support for post processing
- Support for varying the output format based on user preference
- Support for getting PCM output to SPDIF directly using WAVE_FORMAT_DOLBY_AC3_SPDIF type

Issues to think about

- There are issues with the timestamps on the MPEG files produced by the Nebula DVB-T card
  Need to come up with a work around for these (note that the Elecard demuxer has a use bitrate
  flag that works for these)
