Known bugs to fix

- There are some issues with highlights on DVD's
- Subpicture issues with overlay renderer

New functionality to add

- Film detection
- Support for post processing
- Work on colour upsampling

Issues to think about

- There are issues with the timestamps on the MPEG files produced by the Nebula DVB-T card
  Need to come up with a work around for these (note that the Elecard demuxer has a use bitrate
  flag that works for these)
